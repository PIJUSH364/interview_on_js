Here are some **advanced SQL questions** you can ask a **senior backend developer**, especially focused on **query optimization**:

### **Advanced SQL Query Optimization Questions**

1. **Indexing Strategies:**

   - How do you decide which columns should be indexed?
   - What are the differences between clustered and non-clustered indexes?
   - When should you use a composite index instead of a single-column index?
   - How do covering indexes improve query performance?

   Indexes improve database performance by allowing **faster data retrieval**. There are several types of indexes, each optimized for different use cases.

---

## **1. Primary Index (Clustered Index)**

- Automatically created on the **Primary Key**.
- Determines the **physical storage** of rows in the table.
- A table can have **only one clustered index**.

üí° **Example (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Automatically creates a clustered index
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

üîπ Here, `id` is the **clustered index**, and rows are **physically ordered** by it.

---

## **2. Unique Index**

- Ensures that all values in a column (or combination of columns) are **unique**.
- Prevents duplicate values.

üí° **Example**:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON employees(email);
```

üîπ Now, the `email` column **cannot** contain duplicate values.

---

## **3. Non-Clustered Index**

- Stores a **separate structure** with pointers to the actual rows.
- A table **can have multiple** non-clustered indexes.

üí° **Example**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);
```

üîπ Queries filtering by `department` will be faster because the database **doesn't scan the full table**.

---

## **4. Composite Index (Multi-Column Index)**

- Created on **multiple columns** to optimize queries using those columns together.
- **Order matters!** Queries should follow the **left-to-right** sequence of the index.

üí° **Example**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_name ON employees(department, name);
```

üîπ Works efficiently for:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' AND name = 'John';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
```

‚ùå **Inefficient** for:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'John';
```

(Since `department` is the first column in the index, skipping it reduces efficiency.)

---

## **5. Full-Text Index**

- Used for searching large text fields efficiently.
- Supports **fast text-based searches** (e.g., `MATCH ... AGAINST` in MySQL).

üí° **Example (MySQL)**:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_fulltext_description ON articles(description);
```

üîπ Optimized for:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(description) AGAINST('database optimization');
```

üîπ Useful for **search engines**, **blog searches**, etc.

---

## **6. Covering Index**

- An index that contains **all columns** needed for a query, avoiding extra lookups.

üí° **Example**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_covering ON employees(department, name, salary);
```

üîπ Optimized for:

```sql
SELECT department, name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

üîπ Since the **index contains all columns**, the database **doesn't need to fetch from the table**.

---

## **7. Partial Index**

- Indexes **only a subset of rows** to improve performance.
- Used when filtering specific conditions frequently.

üí° **Example (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(status) WHERE status = 'active';
```

üîπ Only **'active'** users are indexed, reducing unnecessary data.

---

## **8. Hash Index**

- Uses a **hash table** for faster **exact matches** (e.g., `=` operator).
- **Not useful for range queries (`<, >, BETWEEN`).**
- Used in **PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.** but **not in MySQL** (except MEMORY tables).

üí° **Example (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_hash_email ON users USING HASH (email);
```

üîπ Optimized for:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';
```

üîπ ‚ùå **Not optimized for**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE 'abc%';
```

(Since hashing doesn‚Äôt support partial matches.)

---

## **9. Bitmap Index**

- Used in **data warehouses** for low-cardinality columns (few unique values).
- Faster for `AND`/`OR` operations on boolean-like data.

üí° **Example (Oracle/PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_gender ON employees(gender);
```

üîπ Optimized for queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE gender = 'Male' OR gender = 'Female';
```
