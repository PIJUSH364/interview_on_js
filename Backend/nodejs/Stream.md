### **Streams in Node.js: Explanation and Use Cases**

#### **What are Streams in Node.js?**

Streams in Node.js are **objects** that allow you to **read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion**, rather than reading or writing the entire data at once. This makes them **efficient** when working with **large files, network communications, or real-time data processing**.

---

### **Types of Streams**

Node.js provides **four types of streams**:

1. **Readable Streams** â†’ Used for reading data
   - Example: `fs.createReadStream()` (reading from a file)
2. **Writable Streams** â†’ Used for writing data
   - Example: `fs.createWriteStream()` (writing to a file)
3. **Duplex Streams** â†’ Can both read and write data
   - Example: `net.Socket` (TCP socket communication)
4. **Transform Streams** â†’ A special type of duplex stream that **modifies data as it passes through**
   - Example: `zlib.createGzip()` (compressing data)

### **Why Use Streams?**

âœ… **Memory Efficient** â†’ No need to load the entire file into memory.  
âœ… **Faster Execution** â†’ Processes data in chunks instead of waiting for the whole file.  
âœ… **Handles Large Data** â†’ Great for streaming files, logs, and network requests.

---

### **Example: Readable Stream (Reading a File)**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Creating a readable stream
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt", { encoding: "utf8" });

// Event listeners to process data
readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

readableStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Finished reading the file.");
});

readableStream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error reading the file:", err);
});
```

ðŸ”¹ This will read the file **chunk by chunk** instead of loading it entirely into memory.

---

### **Example: Writable Stream (Writing to a File)**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Creating a writable stream
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

// Writing data in chunks
writableStream.write("Hello, ");
writableStream.write("this is ");
writableStream.write("a test.\n");

// Ending the stream
writableStream.end("Final line.");
console.log("Data written to file.");
```

ðŸ”¹ The file `output.txt` will be created and populated **chunk by chunk**.

---

### **Example: Piping (Read + Write in One Step)**

Node.js allows **piping** to **directly connect** readable and writable streams.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Pipe: Read from input.txt and write to output.txt
fs.createReadStream("input.txt").pipe(fs.createWriteStream("output.txt"));

console.log("File copied successfully.");
```

ðŸ”¹ This **streams the data from `input.txt` to `output.txt`**, avoiding memory overload.

---

### **Example: Transform Stream (Compressing a File)**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const zlib = require("zlib");

// Create a gzip transform stream
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();

// Pipe: Read, Compress, and Write
fs.createReadStream("input.txt")
  .pipe(gzip)
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream("input.txt.gz"));

console.log("File compressed successfully.");
```

ðŸ”¹ This reads `input.txt`, compresses it using `gzip`, and writes `input.txt.gz` **without loading the whole file into memory**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Streams are essential** for handling large data efficiently in Node.js.
- They allow **chunk-based processing**, preventing high memory consumption.
- **Piping** helps in chaining multiple streams (e.g., reading â†’ compressing â†’ writing).
