### **Difference Between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` in Node.js**

Both `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are used for scheduling asynchronous tasks in the **Node.js Event Loop**, but they execute at different times.

---

### **1️⃣ process.nextTick()**

✅ **Executes before the next event loop iteration starts**  
✅ **Prioritized over I/O tasks, timers, and setImmediate()**  
✅ **Used for urgent operations that should run immediately after the current execution**

📌 **Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log("Inside process.nextTick()");
});

console.log("End");
```

🔹 **Output:**

```
Start
End
Inside process.nextTick()
```

🔹 Even though `process.nextTick()` is asynchronous, it **executes before I/O operations, timers, and the next event loop iteration**.

---

### **2️⃣ setImmediate()**

✅ **Executes in the "check" phase of the event loop**  
✅ **Runs after I/O tasks and before closing events**  
✅ **Used for scheduling tasks that should execute after I/O operations complete**

📌 **Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log("Inside setImmediate()");
});

console.log("End");
```

🔹 **Output:**

```
Start
End
Inside setImmediate()
```

🔹 `setImmediate()` runs **after the synchronous code and after the I/O phase**.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature             | `process.nextTick()`                                      | `setImmediate()`                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Order** | Before the next event loop iteration                      | In the "check" phase of the event loop |
| **Priority**        | Higher (executes before timers & I/O)                     | Lower (executes after I/O operations)  |
| **Use Case**        | Urgent callbacks, fixing issues in the current event loop | Running callbacks after I/O completes  |

---

### **Example: nextTick() vs setImmediate()**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setImmediate(() => console.log("Inside setImmediate()"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("Inside process.nextTick()"));

console.log("End");
```

🔹 **Output:**

```
Start
End
Inside process.nextTick()
Inside setImmediate()
```

🔹 `process.nextTick()` executes **before** `setImmediate()`.

---

### **When to Use Which?**

🔹 Use **`process.nextTick()`** when you need to run a **callback immediately after the current function**, before I/O or timers.  
🔹 Use **`setImmediate()`** when you want to **run a callback in the next event loop iteration, after I/O operations**.
